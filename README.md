# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals

This data shows sales related information for a company, including how their clients interacted with them on their website.
My goals with this project were as follows:
1. To understand the data
2. To answer the pre-set questions
3. To have additional insights from the data
4. Having insights from the data, then deciding what are more relevant business questions I can ask this data, and, how can the answers to these questions help this business.

This data shows, among other things, current sales trends, marketing trends, how customers are interacting with the website (including how much time they're spending on the website), etc.

## Process

In this project, I have:
1. Imported the 5 csv files into a database called ecommerce on my PGAdmin (by creating tables, then creating columns, and then extrapolating from CSV to PGAdmin).
2. After this, I:
a. Reviewed the data
b. Conducted data cleaning and scrubbing by employing various queries (I've provided some of my queries in the related documents, for example in the cleaning_data.md file)
3. Answered the required questions
4. Conducted further analysis of the data to get more insights
5. Created some questions myself, which I also then answered using SQL Queries (the intent of the questions I came up with, was with a view of helping the business become more efficient).
        

## Results
Based on my queries, I see that this company does business all over the world. This also means that the marketing spend goes globally. One of my questions was, which cities have the lowest number of customers.


## Challenges 
I felt that there a lot of insights that can be derived from this data.

## Future Goals
I would spend more time scrubbing the data, getting more insights, and learning further.
